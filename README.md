Training and Assessment Certificate IV
=======================================

#### 2014-2015

This course will (hopefully) result in a Certificate IV - Training and Assesment
(TAE40110) over a six month duration.  Looking at the course there is a LOT of
work to get through in six months, so some of my other projects are on the back burner
yet again.

The course consists of three main clusters which are:

- Assesment Cluster  
- Design Cluster 
- Delivery Cluster

Description
-----------

This qualification reflects the roles of individuals delivering training and assessment services in the vocational education and training (VET) sector.

Achievement of this qualification or an equivalent by trainers and assessors is a requirement of the Australian Quality Training Framework Essential Standards for Registration (Standard 1 as outlined in Appendix 2 of the Users' Guide to the Essential Standards for Registration).

This qualification, or the skill sets derived from units of competency within it, is also suitable preparation for those engaged in the delivery of training and assessment of competence in a workplace context, as a component of a structured VET program.

### Job roles 

Job roles associated with this qualification relate to the delivery of training and assessment of competence within the VET sector. Possible job titles and roles relevant to this qualification include:

- enterprise trainer
- enterprise assessor
- registered training organisation (RTO) trainer
- RTO assessor
- training adviser or training needs analyst
- vocational education teacher.

### Rationale

Mainstream computing has become a little boring of late.  Some of you may
have noticed I have been putting a lot of study time into the Life sciences (Virology, Molecular Biology, Genetics, Epigenetics, Epidemiology) and BioInformatics.

Having a training qualification MAY allow me to teach some of the accumulated knowledge gathered from thirty years of software engineering whilst I continue moving towards the life sciences in study and in work.
